# CIFAR-10 Experiments Guide

## Overview

The `cifar10_experiments.ipynb` notebook implements comprehensive evaluation of MAMBA-GINR on three key capabilities:

1. **Super-Resolution**: 32×32 → 128×128 generation
2. **Jittered Query Decoding**: Robustness with decoupled modulation/hyponet queries
3. **Scale-Invariant Feature Extraction**: Semantic analysis of modulation vectors

## Notebook Structure

### Section 1: Model Architecture (Cells 1-3)
**Components implemented:**
- `BiMamba`: Bidirectional Mamba encoder
- `MambaEncoder`: Stack of Mamba blocks
- `ImplicitSequentialBias`: Learnable position tokens
- `ModulationNetwork`: Extracts scale-invariant features
- `Hyponet`: Continuous decoder
- `MambaGINR_CIFAR`: Complete model

**Key Innovation:** Decoupled queries for modulation extraction and hyponet decoding.

### Section 2: Data Loading (Cell 4)
- CIFAR-10 dataset (50k train, 10k test)
- 10 classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck

### Section 3: Training (Cells 5-7)
**Training protocol:**
- Random coordinate sampling (512 points per image)
- MSE reconstruction loss
- AdamW optimizer with cosine annealing
- ~20 epochs for convergence

**Hyperparameters:**
```python
dim = 256              # Model dimension
num_lp = 32           # Learnable position tokens
mamba_depth = 4       # Mamba encoder depth
hidden_dim = 128      # Modulation/hyponet hidden dim
patch_size = 4        # Input patch size (4×4)
```

## Experiment 1: Super-Resolution

### Goal
Test arbitrary-scale generation capability by generating high-resolution images from models trained on 32×32.

### Implementation (Cells 8-10)

**Key function:**
```python
super_resolve(model, images, target_size=128)
```

**What it does:**
1. Encode 32×32 image → LP features
2. Create 128×128 coordinate grid
3. Decode at high resolution
4. Return 128×128 RGB image

**Tested resolutions:**
- 64×64 (2× super-resolution)
- 128×128 (4× super-resolution)
- 256×256 (8× super-resolution)

**Metrics:**
- PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
- SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)

**Expected results:**
- Model generates plausible high-resolution images
- Better than bicubic upsampling baseline
- Quality degrades gracefully with increasing resolution

### Visualization
- Side-by-side comparison: Original | Bicubic | MAMBA-GINR
- Shows model learns to hallucinate reasonable details

## Experiment 2: Jittered Query Decoding

### Goal
Test the decoupled query mechanism and continuous field prediction by:
1. Extracting modulation at regular coordinates
2. Decoding at perturbed coordinates
3. Measuring robustness to jitter

### Implementation (Cells 11-13)

**Key innovation tested:**
```python
# Different coordinates for modulation and hyponet!
modulation_coords = regular_grid          # (B, N, 2)
hyponet_coords = regular_grid + jitter    # (B, N, 2)

modulation = modulation_net(modulation_coords, lp_features)
rgb = hyponet(hyponet_coords, modulation)
```

**Experiments:**

#### 2.1 Same Jittered Coordinates
- Both modulation and hyponet use same jittered coords
- Tests: σ = 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05
- **Finding**: Model robust to small perturbations

#### 2.2 Different Queries
- Modulation: regular grid
- Hyponet: jittered grid (offset by ≤ max_distance)
- **Finding**: Continuous field interpolation works!

**Metrics:**
- PSNR vs jitter magnitude
- SSIM vs jitter magnitude

**Expected results:**
- Small jitter (σ < 0.01): Minimal quality loss
- Medium jitter (σ ~ 0.02): Slight degradation
- Large jitter (σ > 0.05): Noticeable but still coherent
- Different queries work, proving continuous representation

### Visualization
5 rows showing progression:
1. Original
2. No jitter (baseline)
3. Small jitter (σ=0.005)
4. Medium jitter (σ=0.01)
5. Different queries (modulation ≠ hyponet)

## Experiment 3: Scale-Invariant Feature Extraction

### Goal
Prove that modulation vectors encode semantic information and are meaningful scale-invariant features.

### 3.1 t-SNE Visualization (Cell 15)

**What:** Project modulation vectors to 2D using t-SNE

**Implementation:**
```python
features, coords = extract_modulation_features(model, images, grid_size=32)
# features: (B, H*W, D) - modulation vector per pixel

# Sample 5000 pixels
sampled = features.reshape(-1, D)[sample_indices]

# t-SNE
tsne = TSNE(n_components=2)
features_2d = tsne.fit_transform(sampled)
```

**Visualizations:**
1. Color by pixel RGB → Shows color clustering
2. Color by class label → Shows semantic clustering

**Expected findings:**
- ✓ Similar pixels cluster together
- ✓ Class information partially preserved
- ✓ Features capture both low-level (color) and high-level (semantics)

### 3.2 PCA Analysis (Cells 16-17)

**What:** Analyze principal components of modulation vectors

**Metrics:**
- Variance explained per component
- Cumulative variance
- Number of components for 95% variance

**Visualizations:**
1. Variance explained plot
2. Cumulative variance plot
3. First 3 components as RGB image
4. Individual component heatmaps

**Expected findings:**
- ✓ First ~10-20 components capture most variance
- ✓ Features are relatively low-dimensional
- ✓ Components correspond to visual patterns

### 3.3 Nearest Neighbor Retrieval (Cell 18)

**What:** For query pixels, find nearest neighbors in feature space

**Implementation:**
```python
nn_model = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=10, metric='cosine')
nn_model.fit(features)

distances, indices = nn_model.kneighbors(query_feature)
```

**Visualization:**
- Show query pixel
- Show 10 nearest neighbors with distances
- Repeat for multiple queries

**Expected findings:**
- ✓ Nearest neighbors have similar colors
- ✓ Similar textures cluster together
- ✓ Feature similarity = visual similarity

### 3.4 Cross-Image Spatial Consistency (Cell 19)

**What:** Are features at the same spatial location consistent across images?

**Test locations:**
- Center (0.5, 0.5)
- Four quadrants
- Corners
- Edges

**Metrics:**
1. **Variance across images** at each location
   - Lower = more consistent
2. **Similarity matrix** between locations
   - Are different locations distinguishable?

**Expected findings:**
- ✓ Same location → similar features across images
- ✓ Different locations → different features
- ✓ Spatial position is encoded in features

### 3.5 Feature Interpolation (Cell 20)

**What:** Test continuous field by reconstructing from sparse features

**Experiment:**
1. Extract features at 8×8 grid (64 points)
2. Extract features at 32×32 grid (1024 points)
3. Reconstruct image from both
4. Compare quality

**Visualization:**
- Original 32×32
- Reconstructed from 8×8 sparse sampling
- Reconstructed from 32×32 dense sampling
- Reconstruction error heatmap

**Expected findings:**
- ✓ Dense sampling → accurate reconstruction
- ✓ Sparse sampling → blurrier but coherent
- ✓ Continuous interpolation between points works
- ✓ No aliasing or artifacts

## Additional Experiments (Optional)

### Classification with Frozen Features
```python

features = extract_modulation_features(model, images)
pooled_features = features.mean(dim=1)  # Global average pooling

# Train linear classifier
classifier = nn.Linear(dim, 10)
# ... train on pooled_features ...
```

**Expected:** 60-70% accuracy with frozen features

### Feature Transfer
```python
# Train on CIFAR-10
# Test features on STL-10 or CIFAR-100
```

**Expected:** Features transfer reasonably well

### Attention Analysis
```python
modulation, attn_weights = modulation_net(
    coords, lp_features, return_attention=True
)
# Visualize which LP tokens attend to which coordinates
```

**Expected:** Spatial correspondence between LPs and query positions

## Troubleshooting

### Out of Memory
- Reduce batch size: `batch_size = 16`
- Reduce model size: `dim = 128, num_lp = 16`
- Reduce number of samples: `num_vis_samples = 2000`

### Poor Training
- Increase epochs: `num_epochs = 50`
- Increase sampling: `num_sample_coords = 1024`
- Adjust learning rate: `lr = 5e-5`

### Slow t-SNE
- Reduce samples: `num_vis_samples = 2000`
- Reduce perplexity: `perplexity = 20`
- Use PCA preprocessing
